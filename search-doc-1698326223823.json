You will need the 12-digit account ID and must be able to log into the account with sufficient permissions to provision infrastructure resources. GitLab Community Edition EC2 AMI id - The solution will install a small Gitlab instance where application source code will be stored. The AWS Marketplace provides a free, community edition of Gitlab used by the solution. You will need to subscribe to the marketplace offering. Search for &quot;GitLab Community Edition&quot; by GitLab or use a direct link: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-w6ykryurkesjqOnce your account is subscribed to the Gitlab CE Marketplace offering, save the EC2 AMI for the appropriate region from the &quot;Launch new instance&quot; page as shown in the image below (do not actually launch an instance as this will be done for you during installation). Alternatively, you can query for the AMI using the AWS CLI (substitute the apporpriate region value for the --region option): aws ec2 describe-images --owners &quot;aws-marketplace&quot; --filters &quot;Name=name,Values=*GitLab CE 16.4.0*&quot; --query 'Images[].[ImageId]' --region us-west-2 --output text GitLab Runner image - The solution will set up an EC2 instance as a GitLab Runner to execute GitLab CI/CD pipelines. The Amazon-provided &quot;Jammy&quot; image will be used for the runner image. Save the EC2 AMI for the appropriate region for this AMI. The following AMI command will return the appropriate image id. Replace the value for &quot;--region&quot; to reflect your target region: aws ec2 describe-images --owners &quot;amazon&quot; --filters &quot;Name=name,Values=*ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-20230208*&quot; --query 'Images[].[ImageId]' --region us-west-2 --output text Route 53 Hosted Zone - The solution will ensure secure communcations and set up a certificate for your defined domain. Ensure that a public hosted zone is set up in your account. See the AWS documentation for creating a public hosted zone Okta authentication - The solution uses Okta and RoadieHQ Backstage plugins for authentication of users and groups. You will need a client id, client secret, and API key for configuration of the solution. If you wish to use Okta for authentication, you can sign up a free Workforce Identity Cloud developer account. Once the account is set up, you will need to configure an Okta API key for the RoadieHQ backend catalog pluginA client id and secret are required to set up a Backstage Okta authentication provider. See the Backstage Okta auth documentation for more details. Other IDPs are supported and could be substituted using different plugins. Configuring alternative authentication is not covered in this README, but the Backstage Authentication documentation provides details for other providers.

I don't use Okta. Can i change the identity provider to another one? A. Yes. Backstage supports many IDPs. Once you configure Backstage for your chosen IdP, make sure Backstage catalog is synced with the users and groups from your IDP. Q. I want to use another source control that is not GitLab. How can i do that? A. Backstage supports multiple source control providers which can be integrated through the Backstage config. OPA uses GitLab for several usage scenarios which you will need to migrate to another source control provider: Storing application source codeStoring template source codeStoring pipelines jobs and orchestrationUpdate the Client API plugin that interacts with GitLab to the new source control provider Q. I'm using Terraform, can I use this solution with Terraform to provision application resources? A. Yes. We provide a Node.js Terraform application for demonstration.
