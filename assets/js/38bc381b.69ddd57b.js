They can also import application templates they've written into Backstage. OPA provides several different example application templates and runtime environment scripts that platform engineers can use to get started.

We can't possibly implement every single variation of a toolset chain, so we instead selected popular tools and technologies and based our solution on them. For example, we have integrated with Okta as an identity provider and GitLab for Git hosting and CICD. OPA also provides reference implementations of Infrastructure as Code using CDK and Terraform.  Finally, OPA contains several different application templates that range in technology from Java/Spring to Python/Flask to NodeJS.

However, OPA doesn't lock you in to our default choices. While the OPA team will continue to add features and options into the future, using a unique toolset may require some additional work on the part of your organization to customize the solution. The good news is that there are multiple ways to customize OPA/Backstage. The most common way is to use third party plugins that are already available for Backstage. For example, you could delete the OPA configurations that integrate with the Okta IDP and replace them with plugin configurations that integrate with Active Directory."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In some cases, simply switching plugins won't be enough and you will need to port or alter some OPA code.
