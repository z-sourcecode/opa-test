## CNOE

Enterprises that adopt open source solutions as the foundation of their cloud platforms face the challenge of choosing technologies that will support their business outcomes for 3-5 years. The cost of retooling and re-platforming for large organizations is high, which makes bets on specific technologies fundamental to their technology strategies. In order to de-risk these bets, enterprises take into consideration the investments of their peer organizations. The goal for the CNOE framework is to bring together a cohort of enterprises operating at the same scale so that they can navigate their operational technology decisions together, de-risk their tooling bets, coordinate contribution, and offer guidance to large enterprises on which CNCF technologies to use together to achieve the best cloud efficiencies.
