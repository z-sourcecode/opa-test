# Intro

## What is OPA on AWS?
OPA on AWS brings AWS cloud closer to your developers. The platform allows enterprise to build environments and applications on AWS without requiring to upskill on cloud expertise. OPA on AWS provides a reference implementation for an enterprise grade fully integrated platform. Improving the developer work with a secure and scalable experience for non-cloud developers.

Based on [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/) which is an open-source platform enabling a well built and well-designed user interface for OPA on AWS. The [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/) platform itself has been adopted by over 900 companies as their primary developer portal in the past 3 years and has over 100 plugins available for its end users. OPA on AWS takes Backstage.io to the next level by seamlessly integrating it with AWS and packaging it together for enterprise use.

## Why did we build OPA on AWS?

Enterprise are challenged to integrate with AWS Services while adhering to their operation standards, security guardrails and compliance. In addition, cloud engineers and dev-ops teams are a scarce resource that does not scale. Platform engineering helps to reduce this bottleneck and to enable enterprises to scale and improve their developer experience and the use of AWS Services securely.
